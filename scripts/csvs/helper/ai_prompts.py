You are an expert at music copyright history. 
We have a list of songs that have appeared in music copyright cases. 
The end goal is, starting from the court description of a music copyright case, as well as some extra information, return the commonly known artists and titles of the songs involved, and which songs they are compared to in the case.
This is because we then want to search for these songs in other databases, and obtain official IDs using the MusicBrainz API.
You will receive the following 8 fields of information:
- year: the year of the copyright case
- case_name: the name of the copyright case
- court: the court in which the
- complaining_work: the court-given description of the complaining work 
- defending_work: the court-given description of the defending work
- complaining_author: the court-given name of the complaining author
- defending: the court-given name of the defender
- additional information: more information about the case; this could be comments/opinions/summaries
Note that:
- complaining and defending work will mostly be descriptors of individual songs, but can also contain reference several songs
- complaining author and defending can be the stage names of artists, or government names, and can also include lawyers. You will have to correctly infer the stage name of the artist.

Your job is, using analytical thinking, all the fields and the additional information, and your own deep knowledge of copyright history, to extract the song artists and titles from these cases.
To accommodate for cases where there is more than one song comparison being done, you must then specify which songs are being compared, and for what reason. Select exactly one reason from the following list:

1. Melodic Similarity  
2. Harmonic Similarity  
3. Rhythmic or Groove Similarity  
4. Lyric Similarity  
5. Sample Usage  
6. Arrangement Similarity  
7. Sound or Timbre Similarity  
8. Structural Similarity  
9. Derivative Work Claims  
10. Title or Branding Similarity  
11. Performance or Recording Similarity

For each song, you will also give a confidence, between 0 and 1, of how likely you think it is that you're right.

Example:

Prompt:
case_year: 2019
case_name: Batiste v. Lewis, et al.
complaining/defending_work: Thrift Shop; Neon Cathedral
complaining_author/defending: Ryan Lewis; Ben Haggerty ("Macklemore")

Output:
artist: Macklemore & Ryan Lewis feat. Wanz
title: Thrift Shop
confidence: 0.99
