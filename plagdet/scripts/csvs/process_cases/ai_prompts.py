You are an expert at music copyright history and analysis. Your task is to extract detailed information about song pairs involved in copyright cases. You will be given initial case information and a link to a webpage with more details about the case.

You will receive the following 8 fields of information:
- year: the year of the copyright case
- case_name: the name of the copyright case
- court: the court in which the
- complaining_work: the court-given description of the complaining work 
- defending_work: the court-given description of the defending work
- complaining_author: the court-given name of the complaining author
- defending: the court-given name of the defender
- comments_and_opinions: more information from the web about the case; this could be comments/opinions/summaries
Note that:
- complaining and defending work will mostly be descriptors of individual songs, but can also contain reference several songs
- complaining author and defending can be the stage names of artists, or government names, and can also include lawyers. You will have to correctly infer the stage name of the artist.

For each case, you need to identify pairs of songs that are being compared in the copyright dispute. Each pair consists of two songs, and you need to provide the following information for each song:

- artist: The commonly known artist name
- title: The commonly known song title
- confidence: A value between 0 and 1 indicating your confidence in this information
- evidence: Brief excerpts from the source that supports your conclusion (max 30 words each). These should be direct quotes from the source, and not summaries. DO NOT hallucinate evidence. If there is no evidence, leave the evidence field empty.
- evidence_source: The source of the evidence if evidence is given. For example, this could be the name of the case, or a rough area in the comments and opinions.

Ensure that the artist and title are correctly inferred from the source. For example, do not mistake the publishing label for the artist.
The complaining work and defending work and complaining author and defending can be descriptors will be the best description, and then you should use the rest of the information for validation.

For each pair, you also need to determine:

- is_melodic_comparison: A boolean indicating whether the court case occurred because of some kind of melodic similarity between the songs
- comparison_evidence: Brief excerpts from the source that supports your conclusion about the melodic comparison (max 30 words each). These should be a direct quotes from the source, and not summaries. DO NOT hallucinate evidence. If there is no evidence, leave the evidence field empty.
- evidence_source: The source of the evidence if evidence is given. This could be a rough area in the comments and opinions.

Your output should be structured as follows, where there can be multiple items in the pairs list:

{
  "pairs": [
    {
      "song1": {
        "artist": string,
        "title": string,
        "confidence": float,
        "evidence": list[str],
        "evidence_source": string
      },
      "song2": {
        "artist": string,
        "title": string,
        "confidence": float,
        "evidence": string,
        "evidence_source": string
      },
      "is_melodic_comparison": boolean,
      "comparison_evidence": list[str],
      "evidence_source": string
    }
  ]
}

You may include multiple pairs if the case involves comparisons between multiple songs. Most will be single comparisons.

Comment/Opinion 1:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh dear…  By not dismissing the Plaintiff's chaotic and sprawling Second Amended
Complaint, District Court Judge Martin Feldman may have encouraged Batiste in
this quixotic attempt to capitalize on Defendant's financial success. By the
time he ultimately ruled on the dispute, Feldman was in a far less accommodating
mood towards Batiste. His Order discusses at length Batiste's hilariously
misguided attempt (Feldman, however, was not amused) to file as the report of an
expert musical witness named "Archie Milton", an "expert's report" he wrote
himself! Had the Court had sensibly nipped this claim in the bud, Batiste would
not only have avoided so profoundly embarrassing himself, but also have averted
the $125,000 attorney's fees Feldman subsequently ordered him to reimburse the
Defendants. Then again, what are the chances the Defendants collected these
fees?

Comment/Opinion 2:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Third time's a charm? On May 17, 2018, Hon. Martin Feldman denied Defendants
Ryan Lewis, et al.'s ("Defendants") Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule
12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff Paul Batiste's ("Plaintiff") Second Amended
Complaint in the matter of Paul Batiste v. Ryan Lewis, et al., Case
2:17-cv-04435-MLCF-KWR.  After the initial complaint, an amended complaint, and
now, the second amended complaint, it appears that Plaintiff has alleged facts
sufficient for his lawsuit alleging various copyright infringements by
Defendants in their works "Thrift Shop," "Can't Hold Us," "Need to Know," "Same
Love," and "Neon Cathedral" to move forward.  After filing his initial
complaint, a puzzling mishmash of vague allegations, Plaintiff has had a couple
more bites at the apple, and has introduced lots of additional details to his
infringement claims. While Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint undoubtedly
contains a considerably more detail than his earlier attempts, it remains a
somewhat odd and confusing collection of still puzzling allegations when viewed
from both a legal and musical perspective.  For instance, in describing the
alleged violations in Defendants' work "Thrift Shop," Plaintiff repeatedly
refers to "samples," but it is not clear what Plaintiff means. The "distinct
saxophone of 'Thrift Shop' that is [sic] begins at 0:21:000 is digitally sampled
from World of Blues at 0:16:231 where the lyrics are 'the blues is what you make
it.'" Does Plaintiff actually mean that Defendants have misappropriated part of
the musical composition around the melody in Plaintiff's work? Does Plaintiff
mean that Defendants actually sampled the vocal line from the original sound
recording and transmogrified it into the saxophone ostinato in "Thrift Shop"? Is
Plaintiff claiming to have some sort of copyright in a generic blues melody that
loosely outlines a descending arpeggio?  Plaintiff's claims of infringement in
his brief melodic snippet ("I'm in a world of blues") by Defendants at "I'll
wear your granddad's clothes" near the end of "Thrift Shop" fares no better.
Even if Plaintiff has some sort of copyright interest in this brief snippet,
which is unlikely, Defendants' outlining the root minor triad in comparison with
Plaintiff emphasizing the "blue" note between the minor and major third scale
degree is altogether dissimilar, both melodically and harmonically.  Plaintiff
goes on: "The hi-hat swing of 0:33:864 of 'Hip Jazz' is sample [sic] to create
the introduction of 'Thrift Shop.' Essentially, the strong accent on the last
beat of the four-count measure in 'Hip Jazz' is digitally sampled." Is the hi-
hat sampled or not? How is something "essentially" sampled? Is Plaintiff
claiming copyright in hi-hat swing, or hitting on twos and fours?? If Plaintiff
is claiming actual sampling, as in taking excerpts from Plaintiff's sound
recordings and reusing and recasting them, he may be able to prove up his case,
but at this point, it is not clear quite what Plaintiff is claiming. And either
way, Plaintiff has no copyright in a swung hi-hat.  The claims regarding
Defendants' work "Neon Cathedral" are no less odd. Neon Cathedral "samples" the
melody of "Salsa 4 Elise (Fur Elise)"? Where? How? Plaintiff references the
"hook" of "Salsa 4 Elise (Fur Elise)." Would this be the melody composed by
Beethoven in Bagatelle / Albumblatt No. 25, or part of Plaintiff's guitar
noodling? "[T]he chords of 'Neon Cathedral' at 1:57:247 is [sic] a sample of Fur
Elise at 1:34:181." First, what does Plaintiff mean by "sample," and second, no,
they are not. The harmony in both works moves from tonic to dominant to
submediant, but there is simply no copyright protection available in such a
generic chord sequence. Plaintiff does not point out that the two chord
progressions then move in markedly dissimilar directions.  The foregoing are
just a few examples of peculiarities with Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint.
Notwithstanding what appear to be various nomenclature issues and other
shortcomings in Plaintiff's pleading, the standard for Plaintiff's lawsuit to
survive Defendants' challenge at this point is not high, and the court's ruling
denying Defendants' motion demonstrates as much.  At the outset of its order
denying Defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss, the court had to address a
slightly unusual issue – along with their motion to dismiss, Defendants
submitted their expert's report / musical analysis of the musical works in
question here, along with recordings of the works in question. A Rule 12(b)(6)
motion to dismiss typically only allows the court to consider the pleadings in
making its determination whether to dismiss the matter. However, under Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 12(d), the court may consider documents outside
the pleadings (here, Defendants' expert report), but in so doing, the motion to
dismiss would be treated as a FRCP Rule 56 motion for summary judgment. It is
not clear from the court's opinion whether Defendants countenanced this
possibility when submitting their 12(b)(6) motion. Regardless, the court did not
take the summary judgment route, instead relying on 5th Circuit case law
allowing the court to consider documents referred to in Plaintiffs' complaint
that are "central to the plaintiff's claims." Scanlan v. Texas A&M University,
343 F.3d 533, 536 (5th Cir. 2003).  In so ruling, the court allowed sound
recordings of the various musical works in question as part of its analysis of
Defendants' motion, but did not consider Defendants' expert analysis. At a
minimum, the court's decision not to treat defendants' 12(b)(6) motion as a
motion for summary judgment will prevent additional procedural issues arising
when Defendants move for summary judgment under FRCP Rule 56, as they surely
will should this case not otherwise settle or be dismissed.  The court then
turned to the substantive merits of Defendants' motion to dismiss. When
considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court must consider whether a
plaintiff's complaint, taken as true, plausibly alleges the elements necessary
to establish a successful claim. However, although dismissal at the pleading
stage is strongly disfavored, the factual allegations must rise above the level
of speculative; proper pleading sufficient to survive a 12(b)(6) motion requires
more than "an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation."
Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678-79 (2009) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8).
Here, the court addressed whether Plaintiff's complaint, taken as true,
plausibly alleged the three requirements to a successful claim for all the works
Plaintiff claims were infringed: 1) valid copyright; 2) factual copying through
either access and probative similarity or striking similarity; and 3)
substantial similarity. The court was able to dispose of the first element
quickly, noting that Plaintiff has provided a copyright registration number for
each of his works he claims has been infringed.  As to the second element,
factual copying, the court pointed out that Plaintiff has not alleged sufficient
facts to show access and probative similarity. Plaintiff's Second Amended
Complaint does nothing more than infer and suggest that Defendants had access to
Plaintiff's works. As noted, mere suspicion that Defendants could have found
Plaintiff's music is not sufficient, even at the pleading stage. Plaintiff must
allege facts to show Defendants had a "reasonable opportunity" to view the
work(s). Considering that Plaintiff has now amended his original complaint
twice, the court correctly ruled that after three tries, Plaintiff has failed to
establish access on the part of Defendants. (As an aside, note that the only
version of "Hip Jazz" by Batiste apparently available on YouTube was not
uploaded until several days after Plaintiff filed his initial lawsuit. Odd…)
The court then addressed whether having failed to show access, Plaintiff has
sufficiently pled that the works in question are strikingly similar. This does
not concern an actual substantive musical analysis, but instead, an analysis as
to whether the words of Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint, when taken as
true, are sufficient to meet the standard to show that Plaintiff's works are so
similar to Defendant's alleged infringing works that the only explanation is
direct copying by Defendants of Plaintiff's works.  To quote the court:
"[Plaintiff} meets his burden. He alleges that the defendants willfully copied
several protectable elements of his copyrights. Specifically, he alleges that
Thrift Shop misappropriated the beat, drums, introduction, and bass line of Hip
Jazz and the distinctive melody of World of Blues. He alleges that Neon
Cathedral misappropriates the hook, melody, and chords of Tone Palette, and that
Can't Hold Us copies the beat and bass line of Starlite Pt. 1. Batiste repeats
these allegations for each of his original works. Taken as true, Batiste pleads
that the defendants unlawfully copied large portions of his compositions. If
proven, Batiste would meet his burden to show striking similarity."  Again, note
that the court's conclusion does not weigh in as to whether the works are
actually strikingly similar either factually or as a matter of law. The court is
doing nothing more than determining whether Plaintiff has met the basic pleading
requirements for the lawsuit to more forward. In fact, in the final full
paragraph of the order, the court specifically states that "at the pleading
stage, the Court is limited to the facts alleged in the complaint; it is not
acting as a fact finder… [Plaintiff] meets his burden to allege copyright
infringement." Court's Order, p. 11, emphasis added.  As for the third factor,
substantial similarity, the court made clear that considering Plaintiff's Second
Amended Complaint meets the stringent standard for striking similarity, it also
meets the lower standard for substantial similarity. The court also pointed out
that Plaintiff's complaint cites the elements he claims were sampled, and where
the sampled portions appear in Defendants' works.  So Plaintiff overcame
Defendants' challenge, and lives to fight on. But based on what has been
revealed in the matter thus far, Plaintiff has a hard road to hoe in making a
viable case. Surviving a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss is not hard, and should
be no cause for celebration for Plaintiff. Perhaps there is more to this lawsuit
than currently meets the eye, but at least one thing is for certain: the legal
bills will continue to mount. Stay tuned…  *** Complaint: (PDF) Second Amended
