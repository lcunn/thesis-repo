#   This function will search through `quantized_sequence` for monophonic

#   Once a note-on event in a track is encountered, a melody begins.
#   Gaps of silence in each track will be splitting points that divide the
#   track into separate melodies. The minimum size of these gaps are given
#   in `gap_bars`. The size of a bar (measure) of music in time steps is
#   computed from the time signature stored in `quantized_sequence`.

#   The melody is then checked for validity. The melody is only used if it is
#   at least `min_bars` bars long, and has at least `min_unique_pitches` unique
#   notes (preventing melodies that only repeat a few notes, such as those found
#   in some accompaniment tracks, from being used).

#   After scanning each instrument track in the quantized sequence, a list of all
#   extracted Melody objects is returned.

#     quantized_sequence: A quantized NoteSequence.
#     search_start_step: Start searching for a melody at this time step. Assumed

#     min_bars: Minimum length of melodies in number of bars. Shorter melodies are
#         discarded.
#     max_steps_truncate: Maximum number of steps in extracted melodies. If
#         defined, longer melodies are truncated to this threshold. If pad_end is
#         also True, melodies will be truncated to the end of the last bar below
#         this threshold.
#     max_steps_discard: Maximum number of steps in extracted melodies. If
#         defined, longer melodies are discarded.
#     gap_bars: A melody comes to an end when this number of bars (measures) of
#         silence is encountered.
#     min_unique_pitches: Minimum number of unique notes with octave equivalence.
#         Melodies with too few unique notes are discarded.
#     ignore_polyphonic_notes: If True, melodies will be extracted from
#         `quantized_sequence` tracks that contain polyphony (notes start at
#         the same time). If False, tracks with polyphony will be ignored.
#     pad_end: If True, the end of the melody will be padded with NO_EVENTs so
#         that it will end at a bar boundary.
#     filter_drums: If True, notes for which `is_drum` is True will be ignored.
